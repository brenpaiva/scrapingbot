Polite, Jr., the Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, and James C. Lee, the Chief of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), announced that TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET LM ERICSSON (“ERICSSON”), a multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, has agreed to plead guilty and pay a criminal penalty of more than $206 million after breaching a 2019 Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”). ERICSSON breached the DPA by violating the agreement’s cooperation and disclosure provisions.  Based on the same underlying criminal conduct that gave rise to the DPA, ERICSSON will plead guilty to engaging in a long-running scheme to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) by paying bribes, falsifying books and records, and failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls in multiple countries around the world. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Ericsson engaged in significant FCPA violations and made an agreement with the Department of Justice to clean up its act.  The company’s breach of its obligations under the DPA indicate that Ericsson did not learn its lesson, and it is now facing a steep price for its continued missteps.  As Ericsson’s anticipated guilty plea makes abundantly clear, the Southern District of New York will hold to account companies that fail to live up to obligations to root out and voluntarily report their misconduct to the Department of Justice.” Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. said: “When the Department afforded Ericsson the opportunity to enter into a DPA to resolve an investigation into serious FCPA violations, the company agreed to comply with all provisions of that agreement.  Instead of honoring that commitment, Ericsson repeatedly failed to fully cooperate and failed to disclose evidence and allegations of misconduct in breach of the agreement.  As a result of these broken promises, Ericsson must plead guilty to two criminal offenses and pay an additional fine.  Companies should be on notice that we will closely scrutinize their compliance with all terms of corporate resolution agreements and that there will be serious consequences for those that fail to honor their commitments.” IRS-CI Chief James C. Lee said: “Today’s more than $200 million criminal penalty against Ericsson underscores the significant consequences that result when a DPA is breached.  Ericsson’s multiple cooperation and disclosure failures led to this breach, resulting in the company having to plead guilty and pay additional penalties.” According to court documents: Beginning in 2000 and continuing until 2016, ERICSSON used third-party agents and consultants to make bribe payments to government officials and to manage off-the-books slush funds in Djibouti, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Kuwait.  These agents were often engaged through sham contracts and paid pursuant to false invoices, and the payments to the agents were improperly accounted for in ERICSSON’s books and records.  In 2019, ERICSSON resolved this criminal conduct by entering a DPA with the Department in connection with a two-count criminal information filed in the Southern District of New York.  As part of the DPA, ERICSSON paid a total criminal penalty of over $520 million and agreed to the imposition of an independent compliance monitor for three years.  An ERICSSON subsidiary, Ericsson Egypt Ltd, also pled guilty to a one-count criminal information charging conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Following the 2019 resolution, ERICSSON breached the DPA by failing to truthfully disclose all factual information and evidence related to the Djibouti scheme, the China scheme, and other potential violations of the FCPA’s anti-bribery or accounting provisions.  ERICSSON also failed to promptly report and disclose evidence and allegations of conduct related to its business activities in Iraq that may constitute a violation of the FCPA.  These disclosure failures prevented the United States from bringing charges against certain individuals and taking key investigative steps. *                *                * Under the terms of the plea agreement, which must be accepted by the court, ERICSSON agreed to plead guilty to the original charges deferred by the 2019 DPA: one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to violate the internal controls and books and records provisions of the FCPA.  ERICSSON will also be required to serve a term of probation through June 2024 and has agreed to a one-year extension of the independent compliance monitor.  The plea agreement also requires ERICSSON to pay an additional criminal penalty of $206,728,848 – which includes the elimination of any cooperation credit originally awarded pursuant to the DPA. Mr. Williams praised the efforts of the IRS-CI, which conducted the investigation in this case. The case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit and the Justice Department’s Fraud Section.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys David Abramowicz and Juliana Murray and Trial Attorney Michael Culhane Harper are in charge of the prosecution.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts announced today that Raytheon will pay over $574 million to resolve criminal civil liability for overcharging government contracts. Raytheon has entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in connection with a criminal Information filed today in the District of Massachusetts charging Raytheon with two counts of major fraud against the United States. Raytheon has agreed to pay $147 million to resolve the criminal allegations. Today’s settlement with the District of Massachusetts also resolves civil allegations that Raytheon provided untruthful certified cost or pricing data when negotiating prices with the DOD for numerous government contracts and double billed DOD on a weapons maintenance contract. Raytheon has agreed to pay $428 million, the second largest government procurement fraud recovery under the False Claims Act, to resolve the civil allegations. Under both resolutions, Raytheon will pay a total of $574.7 million. Under the terms of the DPA, Raytheon will pay $146.7 million in a criminal monetary penalty, $111.2 million in victim compensation and retain an independent compliance monitor for three years. Separately, Raytheon entered into a three-year DPA in connection with a criminal information unsealed today in the Eastern District of New York charging Raytheon with two counts: conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provision of the FCPA for a scheme to bribe a government official in Qatar and conspiracy to violate the AECA for willfully failing to disclose the bribes in export licensing applications with the Department of State as required by Part 130 of ITAR. The agreements in Boston the District of Massachusetts and the Eastern District of New York require that Raytheon retain an independent compliance monitor for three years, enhance its internal compliance program, report evidence of additional misconduct to the Justice Department, and cooperate in any ongoing or future criminal investigations. Raytheon also reached a separate False Claims Act settlement with the department relating to the defective pricing schemes. The Justice Department’s FCPA and ITAR resolution is coordinated with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, the Justice Department’s resolutions ensure that the appropriate federal agencies can proceed with determining whether Raytheon or any other individuals or entities associated with the company should be suspended or debarred as federal contractors. Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), when more than one agency has an interest in an entity’s potential suspension or debarment, the FAR requires that the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee (ISDC) identify the lead agency for conducting governmentwide suspension or debarment proceedings. In connection with this resolution, the Justice Department has referred Raytheon’s factual admissions to the appropriate officials within the DOD to initiate the process with the ISDC to identify which federal agency will take the lead in such administrative proceedings, which occur independently of the Justice Department’s criminal and civil resolutions. “Through deliberate and deceptive actions, Raytheon not only defrauded the U.S. government – it compromised the integrity of our defense procurement process,” said Acting United States Attorney Joshua S. Levy. “Our office is committed to holding accountable those who prioritize profits over national security and clear legal obligations. This case underscores our unwavering commitment to pursuing justice, particularly when taxpayer dollars and DOD operations are at stake. We will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to ensure that this type of misconduct is fully exposed and addressed with serious consequences.” “Raytheon engaged in criminal schemes to defraud the U.S. government in connection with contracts for critical military systems and to win business through bribery in Qatar,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin Driscoll of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Such corrupt and fraudulent conduct, especially by a publicly traded U.S. defense contractor, erodes public trust and harms the Department of Defense, businesses that play by the rules, and American taxpayers. Today’s resolutions, with criminal and civil penalties totaling nearly $1 billion, reflect the Criminal Division’s ability to tackle the most significant and complex white-collar cases across multiple subject matters.” “Government contractors have an obligation to be fully transparent about their cost and pricing data when they seek an award of a sole source contract,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department will use all available tools to hold accountable contractors that knowingly provide inflated pricing information or otherwise violate their legal obligations when negotiating or performing contracts with the United States.” “Investigating procurement fraud impacting DOD contracts is a top priority for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), the law enforcement arm of the DOD Office of Inspector General,” said Inspector General Robert Storch for the Department of Defense. “When DOD contractors fail to provide truthful pricing data and overcharge the government, they undermine the integrity of the DOD procurement process and harm critical DOD programs. The DCIS will continue to work with its law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice to ensure DOD contractors that engage in defective pricing schemes are held accountable for their actions. The Defense Contract Audit Agency's Operations Investigative Support Division provided valuable expertise during this investigation.” “We rely on private contractors to help build our unparalleled defense technology, not to pull the wool over our eyes by convincing the government to shell out tens of millions more than what their technology is actually worth,” said Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Boston Division. “Today’s settlement holds Raytheon both criminally and financially responsible for doing just that, using fraud and deceit to gouge American taxpayers to boost its company’s bottom line. The FBI and our partners will not hesitate to investigate any entity that sets out to undermine the principles of fair and free competition to defraud the federal government and waste precious tax dollars.” “This recovery exemplifies the commitment of the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division to ensure that contracts supporting our warfighters are executed effectively and fairly, guaranteeing our armed forces remain unmatched in capability and lethality,” said Special Agent-in-Charge Keith K. Kelly, Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division’s (CID) Fraud Field Office. “Army CID applauds the efforts of our partners in this investigation and recovery. We will continue to work tirelessly to defend our defense procurement enterprise against any party which would seek financial advantage to the detriment of our men and women in uniform.” “Any attempt to defraud the government also degrades our military’s ability to invest in the capabilities needed to protect our nation,” said Special Agent Jason Hein of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) Director of Procurement Fraud. “The AFOSI procurement fraud team is committed to working with our partners to protect the procurement process and the government funds entrusted to the Department of the Air Force.” According to admissions and court documents filed in the District of Massachusetts, Raytheon employees provided false and misleading information to the DOD during contract negotiations concerning two contracts with the United States for the benefit of a foreign partner, one to purchase PATRIOT missile systems and the other to operate and maintain a radar station. In both instances, Raytheon employees provided false and deceptive information to DOD in order to mislead DOD into awarding the two contracts at inflated prices. These schemes to defraud caused the DOD to pay Raytheon $111.2 million more than Raytheon should have been paid on the contracts. Raytheon cooperated with the investigation and engaged in remedial measures, including, terminating employees who remained at the company that were responsible for the misconduct; establishing a broad defective pricing awareness campaign; developing and implementing policies, procedures and controls relating to defective pricing compliance; and engaging additional resources with appropriate expertise to evaluate and test the new policies, procedures and controls relating to defective pricing compliance. Pursuant to the DPA, Raytheon has also agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years, and Raytheon and RTX have agreed to continue to implement a compliance and ethics program at Raytheon designed to prevent and detect fraudulent conduct throughout its operations. Raytheon and RTX also agreed to continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice in any ongoing or future criminal investigations by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section or the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts. Under the False Claims Act settlement Raytheon will pay $428 million for knowingly failing to provide truthful certified cost and pricing data during negotiations on numerous government contracts between 2009 and 2020, in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA). Congress enacted TINA in 1962 to help level the playing field in sole source contracts, where there is no price competition, by making sure that government negotiators have access to the cost or pricing data that the offeror used when developing its proposal. As part of the settlement, Raytheon admitted that it failed to disclose cost or pricing data, as required by TINA, regarding its labor and material costs to supply weapons systems to DOD, and that it failed to disclose cost or pricing data, as required by TINA, regarding its labor costs to staff a radar station. As a result, Raytheon overcharged the United States and received profits in excess of the negotiated profit rates. Raytheon also admitted it billed the same costs twice on a maintenance contract for the DOD. The DOD’s Principal Director of Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy, Mr. John Tenaglia said, “The Defense Department greatly appreciates DOJ’s outstanding efforts culminating in this significant recovery. The price we pay for equipment and services absolutely matters. The more we pay, the less combat capability we can deliver for our nation’s warfighters. This DOJ recovery both restores funding that will be used to acquire more capability while also serving as a strong deterrent to all companies that might seek to deny DOD contracting officers with factual information they require to negotiate contracts at fair and reasonable prices.” “During the course of a Truth in Negotiations audit, DCAA’s auditors found indicators of suspected irregular conduct and elevated these concerns to the Department of Defense Inspector General and the Department of Justice. DCAA’s Investigative Support team assisted on the case and provided valuable insight into the calculations of the damages to the Government.  Preventing fraud and ensuring a fair and reasonable price for products is everyone’s job and DCAA is a valuable member of the team required to investigate and prosecute those who seek to defraud the government,” said Terri L. Dilly, Director, Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The civil settlement includes a resolution of a lawsuit filed under the qui tam or whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, which permits private parties to file suit on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in a portion of the Government’s recovery.  The qui tam lawsuit was filed by a former Raytheon employee, and is captioned United States ex rel. Atesoglu v. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation , 21-CV-10690-PBS (D. Mass.). The whistleblower will receive $4.2 million as her share of the settlement. The criminal case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian LaMacchia and Benjamin Saltzman of the District of Massachusetts and Assistant Chief Kyle Hankey, Acting Assistant Chief Laura Connelly and Trial Attorney Tamara Livshiz of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. The case was investigated by DCIS, Army-CID, FBI and Air Force OSI. The civil investigation was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian LaMacchia of the District of Massachusetts, along with Trial Attorneys Art J. Coulter, Patrick Klein and Jared S. Wiesner of the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section."}

SAP’s resolution with the department stems from schemes to pay bribes to government officials in South Africa and Indonesia. The department’s resolution is coordinated with prosecutorial authorities in South Africa, as well as with the SEC. According to court documents, SAP entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the department in connection with a criminal information filed in the Eastern District of Virginia charging the company with two counts: conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA relating to its scheme to pay bribes to South African officials, and conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provision of the FCPA for its scheme to pay bribes to Indonesian officials. “SAP has accepted responsibility for corrupt practices that hurt honest businesses engaging in global commerce,” said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. “We will continue to vigorously prosecute bribery cases to protect domestic companies that follow the law while participating in the international marketplace.” “SAP paid bribes to officials at state-owned enterprises in South Africa and Indonesia to obtain valuable government business,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s resolution—our second coordinated resolution with South African authorities in just over a year—marks an important moment in our ongoing fight against foreign bribery and corruption. We look forward to continuing to strengthen our relationship with South African authorities and others around the world. This case demonstrates not only the critical importance of coordinated international efforts to combat corruption, but also how our corporate enforcement policies incentivize companies to be good corporate citizens, by cooperating with our investigations and appropriately remediating, so that we can take strong action to address misconduct.” According to court documents, SAP and its co-conspirators made bribe payments and provided other things of value intended for the benefit of South African and Indonesian foreign officials, delivering money in the form of cash payments, political contributions, and wire and other electronic transfers, along with luxury goods purchased during shopping trips. Specifically, with respect to South Africa, between approximately 2013 and 2017, SAP, through certain of its agents, engaged in a scheme to bribe South African officials and to falsify SAP’s books, records, and accounts, all with the goal of obtaining improper advantages for SAP in connection with various contracts with South African departments, agencies, and instrumentalities, including the City of Johannesburg, the City of Tshwane, the Department of Water and Sanitation (a South African state-owned and state-controlled custodian of water services), and Eskom Holdings Limited (a South African state-owned and state-controlled energy company). “This successful resolution against SAP is another example of the power of relationships and persistence,” said Assistant Director in Charge Donald Always of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “The sustained diligence by the prosecution team and continuous collaboration with South African law enforcement, regulators, and prosecutors identified corrupt activity in multiple countries. The FBI will continue our nonstop efforts to identify, investigate, and prosecute companies willfully engaging in corrupt activities around the world.” In addition, between approximately 2015 and 2018, SAP, through certain of its agents, engaged in a scheme to bribe Indonesian officials to obtain improper business advantages for SAP in connection with various contracts between and among SAP and Indonesian departments, agencies, and instrumentalities, including the Kementerian Kelautan dan Perikanan (the Indonesian Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries) and Balai Penyedia dan Pengelola Pembiayaan Telekomunikasi dan Informatika (an Indonesian state-owned and state-controlled Telecommunications and Information Accessibility Agency). “When the mails are used in furtherance of a fraud or corruption scheme, borders are not an obstacle for U.S. Postal Inspectors,” said Postal Inspector in Charge of Criminal Investigations Eric Shen. “Postal inspectors, with our FBI law enforcement partners and Justice Department prosecutors, followed the wide-spread trail of bribes and corruption from South Africa to Indonesia. This joint effort resulted in the defendant company paying a significant criminal penalty and agreeing to long-term remedial measures.” Pursuant to the DPA, SAP will pay a criminal penalty of $118.8 million and administrative forfeiture of $103,396,765. SAP will also continue cooperating with the department in any ongoing or future criminal investigation arising during the term of the DPA. In addition, the department will credit up to $55.1 million of the criminal penalty against amounts that SAP pays to resolve an investigation by law enforcement authorities in South Africa for related conduct. The department will credit up to the full forfeiture amount against disgorgement that SAP pays to the SEC or South African authorities. Under Part I of the Criminal Division’s March 2023 Compensation Incentives and Clawbacks Pilot Program, SAP’s compliance obligations include a commitment to implementing criteria relating to compliance in the company’s compensation and bonus system, subject to local labor laws. Under Part II of the Pilot Program, the department reduced the criminal penalty by $109,141 for compensation that SAP withheld from qualifying employees, which action the company defended in substantial litigation. The department reached this resolution with SAP based on a number of factors, including, among others, the nature and seriousness of the offense. SAP received credit for its cooperation with the department’s investigation, which included (i) immediately beginning to cooperate after South African investigative reports made public allegations of the South Africa-related misconduct in 2017 and providing regular, prompt, and detailed updates to the department regarding factual information obtained through its own internal investigation, which allowed the government to preserve and obtain evidence as part of its independent investigation; (ii) expeditiously producing relevant documents and other information to the department from multiple foreign countries, while navigating foreign data privacy and related laws; (iii) at the request of the department, voluntarily making company officers and employees available for interviews; (iv) taking significant affirmative steps to facilitate interviews while addressing witness security concerns; (v) raising and resolving potential deconfliction issues between SAP’s internal investigation and the investigation being conducted by the department; (vi) promptly collecting, analyzing, and organizing voluminous information, including complex financial information, at the request of the department; (vii) translating voluminous foreign language documents to facilitate and expedite review by the department; and (viii) imaging the phones of relevant custodians at the beginning of SAP’s internal investigation, thus preserving relevant and highly probative business communications sent on mobile messaging applications. SAP also engaged in timely remedial measures, including: (i) conducting an analysis of the root causes of the underlying conduct and gap analysis, and undertaking appropriate remediation to address those root causes and enhance its compliance program; (ii) undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on high risk areas and controls around payment processes and enhancing its regular compliance risk assessment process, including by incorporating comprehensive operational and compliance data into its risk assessments; (iii) eliminating its third-party sales commission model globally, and prohibiting all sales commissions for public sector contracts in high-risk markets; (iv) significantly increasing the budget, resources, and expertise devoted to compliance and restructuring its Offices of Ethics and Compliance to ensure adequate stature, independence, autonomy, and access to executive leadership; (v) enhancing its code of conduct and policies and procedures regarding gifts, hospitality, and the use of third parties; (vi) enhancing its reporting, investigations, and consequence management processes; (vii) adjusting compensation incentives to align with compliance objectives and reduce corruption risk; (viii) enhancing and expanding compliance monitoring and audit programs, planning, and resources, including developing a well-resourced team devoted to audits of third-party partners and suppliers; (ix) expanding its data analytics capabilities to cover over 150 countries, including all high-risk countries globally; and (x) promptly disciplining any and all employees involved in the misconduct. In light of these considerations as well as SAP’s prior history, which include a non-prosecution agreement from 2021 with the department’s National Security Division, as well as administrative agreements with the Departments of Commerce and the Treasury relating to export law violations, and a resolution in 2016 with the SEC concerning alleged FCPA violations in Panama, the criminal penalty calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines reflects a 40% reduction off the tenth percentile above the low end of the otherwise applicable guidelines fine range. The FBI’s International Corruption Unit and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Heidi B. Gesch for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorneys William E. Schurmann, Anthony Scarpelli, and Gwendolyn A. Stamper and Assistant Chief Jonathan P.

(Trafigura), an international commodities trading company with its primary operations in Switzerland, pleaded guilty today and will pay over $126 million to resolve an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), stemming from the company’s corrupt scheme to pay bribes to Brazilian government officials to secure business with Brazil’s state-owned and state-controlled oil company, Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras (Petrobras). Trafigura pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Trafigura will pay a criminal fine of $80,488,040 and forfeiture of $46,510,257. The department will credit up to $26,829,346 of the criminal fine against amounts Trafigura pays to resolve an investigation by law enforcement authorities in Brazil for related conduct. “Our office will continue to target anyone who uses the Southern District of Florida to further foreign corrupt practices and bribery schemes,” said U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida. “We will continue to work with our Criminal Division colleagues to identify and prosecute those responsible, including both individuals and corporations.” “For more than a decade, Trafigura bribed Brazilian officials to illegally obtain business and reap over $61 million in profits,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s guilty plea underscores that when companies pay bribes and undermine the rule of law, they will face significant penalties. The department remains determined to combat foreign bribery and hold accountable those who violate the law.” According to court documents, between approximately 2003 and 2014, Trafigura and its co-conspirators paid bribes to Petrobras officials in order to obtain and retain business with Petrobras. Beginning in 2009, Trafigura and its co-conspirators, who met in Miami to discuss the bribery scheme, agreed to make bribe payments of up to 20 cents per barrel of oil products bought from or sold to Petrobras by Trafigura and to conceal the bribe payments through the use of shell companies, and by funneling payments through intermediaries who used offshore bank accounts to deliver cash to officials in Brazil. Trafigura profited approximately $61 million from the corrupt scheme. “Trafigura’s corrupt practices violated the FCPA, and today’s resolution demonstrates that there are steep penalties for any company that tries to bribe government officials,” said Assistant Director Michael Nordwall of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. The department reached this resolution with Trafigura based on a number of factors, including, among others, the nature and seriousness of the offense. Trafigura received credit for its cooperation with the department’s investigation and affirmative acceptance of responsibility, which included (i) providing timely updates on facts learned during its internal investigation; (ii) making factual presentations to the department; (iii) facilitating the interviews of employees and agents, including an employee located outside the United States, and arranging for counsel for employees where appropriate; (iv) producing relevant non-privileged documents and data to the department, including documents located outside the United States in ways that navigated foreign data privacy laws, accompanied by translations of certain documents; and (v) providing all relevant facts known to it, including information about individuals involved in the conduct. However, and particularly during the early phase of the department’s investigation, Trafigura failed to preserve and produce certain documents and evidence in a timely manner and, at times, took positions that were inconsistent with full cooperation. Trafigura also engaged in remedial measures, including: (i) developing and implementing enhanced, risk-based policies and procedures relating to, among other things, anti-corruption, use of intermediaries and consultants, third party payments, and joint venture and equity investment risk assessment; (ii) enhancing processes and controls around high-risk transactions; (iii) investment of additional resources in employee training and compliance testing; (iv) enhancing ongoing compliance monitoring and controls testing processes; and (v) proactively discontinuing the use of third-party agents for business origination. However, Trafigura was slow to exercise disciplinary and remedial measures for certain employees whose conduct violated company policy. In addition, Trafigura’s prior misconduct, though not recent, includes a 2006 guilty plea by Trafigura AG for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 542 (entry of goods by means of false statements); as well as Trafigura’s 2010 conviction of violating Netherlands export and environmental laws in connection with the discharge of petroleum waste in Côte d’Ivoire. While Trafigura ultimately accepted responsibility for its criminal conduct in this investigation, its early posture in resolution negotiations also caused significant delays and required the department to expend substantial efforts and resources to develop additional admissible evidence before Trafigura constructively reengaged in agreeing to a negotiated resolution.  Accordingly, the department determined that the appropriate resolution in this case was for Trafigura to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. The criminal fine calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines reflects a 10% reduction off the fifth percentile of the applicable guidelines fine range, which accounts for Trafigura’s cooperation and remediation, as well as its prior history. The FBI Los Angeles Field Office is investigating the case, with assistance from the FBI’s International Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eli S. Rubin and Joshua Paster, Trial Attorneys Natalie Kanerva and Clayton P. Solomon, and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P.

According to the company’s admissions in connection with the resolution, between 2015 and 2020, AAR conspired to pay bribes to government officials to obtain and retain business with state-owned airlines in Nepal and South Africa. AAR obtained profits of nearly $24 million as a result of the scheme. “Companies competing on a fair and level playing field is a core value that we expect any U.S. company or anyone doing business in the United States to embrace,” said U.S. Attorney Graves. “Bribery schemes, whether based inside or outside the United States, harm consumers and companies that are trying to lawfully run their businesses. That is why this office, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to diligently pursue any individual or company that seeks to profit through corrupt or illegal means.” “AAR bribed high-level government officials to obtain business with state-owned airlines in Nepal and South Africa and reaped nearly $24 million in illicit profits as a result,” said Chief Counselor Brent Wible of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The Justice Department continues to hold companies and individuals accountable for engaging in international corruption. Today’s resolution also demonstrates how companies that proactively report misconduct, extensively cooperate, and timely and appropriately remediate will receive credit under the Criminal Division’s Corporate Enforcement and Voluntary Self-Disclosure Policy, including in the form of the agreement, the amount of cooperation and remediation credit, and the length of the term.” “AAR, through its bribery of government officials in Nepal and South Africa, violated U.S. law enacted to ensure that U.S. businesses do not engage in foreign corruption,” said Special Agent in Charge William S. Walker of the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York Field Office. “Today’s outcome reflects HSI’s steadfast commitment to enforcing accountability within global commerce. HSI New York will continue to pursue all necessary measures to ensure that those who engage in corrupt practices, regardless of their location or position, are held fully accountable under the law.” In Nepal, AAR corruptly obtained business with Nepal Airlines Corporation, the state-owned airline of Nepal, related to the sale of two Airbus A330-200 aircraft by offering and paying bribes to Nepali officials through various intermediary companies. In South Africa, AAR corruptly obtained the award of an aircraft component support contract with South African Airways Technical, a wholly owned subsidiary of South African Airways, the state-owned airline of South Africa, by corruptly offering and paying bribes to South African officials through a third-party agent. As part of the NPA, AAR agreed to pay a penalty of approximately $26,363,029 penalty and $18,568,713 in administrative forfeiture. In addition, AAR will pay $29,236,624 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest as part of the resolution of the SEC’s parallel investigation . The Justice Department has agreed to credit the forfeiture to be paid to the department against disgorgement AAR has agreed to pay to the SEC. Pursuant to the NPA, AAR has agreed, among other things, to continue to cooperate with the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia in any ongoing or future criminal investigations arising during the term of the NPA. In addition, AAR agreed to continue to enhance its compliance program and report to the Department regarding remediation and the implementation of compliance measures during the eighteen-month term of the NPA. The Department reached this resolution with AAR based on a number of factors, including, among others, the nature and seriousness of the offense. AAR self-reported to the Department conduct that forms, in part, the basis for the resolution; however, the self-report was not a “voluntary self-disclosure” as defined in the Criminal Division Corporate Enforcement and Voluntary Self-Disclosure Policy (CEP). Prior to the self-report, several English-language articles had been published in media outlets in Nepal and South Africa that described potential irregularities in the relevant contracts in both countries, including that an AAR subsidiary had been summoned by a Nepalese agency investigating irregularities and corruption in connection with the procurement of aircraft. In addition, twelve days before AAR’s self-report, an independent source reported the allegations regarding the Nepal conduct to the Department. AAR received credit under the CEP for its cooperation with the Department’s investigation, which included (i) self-reporting the conduct that forms, at least in part, the basis for the resolution before AAR was aware the conduct had come to the attention of the Department; (ii) promptly providing information obtained through its internal investigation, which allowed the government to preserve and obtain evidence as part of its own independent investigation; (iii) proactively preserving, imaging, and conducting extensive forensic analysis of key electronic evidence, which included imaging mobile devices, recovering deleted documents, forensically recreating attachments from log files, and decrypting recovered chat messages; (iv) making regular and detailed presentations to the Department; (v) promptly collecting, analyzing, and organizing voluminous information, including complex financial information; (vi) meeting the Department’s requests promptly; (vii) voluntarily making employees, including foreign-based employees, available for interviews; (viii) collecting and producing voluminous relevant documents and translations to the Department, including documents located outside the United States; and (ix) producing documents to the Department from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws. AAR also engaged in extensive and timely remedial measures including, among other things (i) conducting an enterprise-wide review of all existing high-risk third-party representatives and reducing its use of international sales agents; (ii) enhancing protocols regarding onboarding and vetting of third-party engagements, including heightened diligence and senior-level approvals; (iii) taking employment actions, including promptly separating one employee involved in the relevant conduct and disciplining other employees with oversight responsibilities; (iv) strengthening its anti-corruption compliance program by investing in compliance resources and expanding its compliance function with experienced and qualified personnel, including appointing a Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer and hiring a compliance monitoring manager; (v) implementing a compliance risk assessment program which has enabled AAR to proactively identify new areas of risk; (vi) enhancing public bidding policies and monitoring implementation of those enhancements; (vii) beginning to roll out a messaging application retention tool; (viii) implementing compliance auditing and periodic anti-corruption site reviews; and (ix) engaging in continuous testing, monitoring, and improvement of its compliance program. In light of these considerations, the criminal penalty calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines reflects a 45% reduction off the applicable Guidelines sentence. The Department gave significant weight in evaluating the appropriate disposition of this matter—including the form of the resolution, the reduction in the penalty amount based on cooperation and remediation credit, and the length of the term—to the Company’s self-report of the misconduct before the Company was aware the conduct had already come to the Department’s attention. The Department previously charged two individuals in related matters. Deepak Sharma, a former AAR subsidiary executive, pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia on August 1, 2024, to a conspiracy to violate the FCPA for his role in the Nepal scheme. Julian Aires, a third-party agent of AAR, pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia on July 15, 2024, to a conspiracy to violate the FCPA for his role in the South Africa scheme. HSI New York is investigating the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Madhu Chugh for the District of Columbia is prosecuting the case along with Acting Assistant Chief Katherine Raut and Trial Attorney Paul Ream of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs assisted in the matter. The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act matters.

Javier Aguilar is expected to make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Yvonne Ho in Houston at 2 p.m. today. The five-count indictment, returned Aug. 3, alleges Aguilar was a former manager and oil trader for Vitol Inc., the U.S. affiliate of the Vitol group of companies which together form one of the largest energy trading firms in the world. The former employee allegedly agreed with others to bribe Mexican officials in order to win business advantages related to contracts with the Mexican government instrumentality, PEMEX Procurement International (PPI). He is also charged with money laundering in connection with the scheme. Between August 2017 and July 2020, the charges allege Aguilar and others knowingly, willfully and corruptly offered and paid bribes to and for the benefit of Mexican officials. He allegedly intended to obtain and retain business for Vitol related to Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), a state-owned oil company of Mexico, and PPI, a wholly-owned and controlled subsidiary of PEMEX with its principal place of business in Houston. Aguilar allegedly met with procurement managers at PPI between September 2017 and April 2018 and agreed to pay bribes for confidential, inside information to assist Vitol in winning business from PPI, including a contract to supply ethane to PEMEX through PPI. In particular, Aguilar allegedly agreed to make payments totaling approximately $600,000 in order to assist Vitol in winning the ethane contract. To promote the bribery scheme and to conceal the proceeds derived from it, Aguilar and his co-conspirators caused the bribes to be paid through a series of transactions and shell companies, according to the charges. Aguilar is charged with violating the FCPA and conspiracy to do so, which both carry a possible five-year-federal prison sentence as does a conviction of violation of the Travel Act. If convicted of either of the two money laundering charges, he could receive up to 20 years in prison. The FBI’s International Corruption Unit - Miami Field Office conducted the investigation.

BIT Mining Ltd. has agreed to resolve investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into related FCPA violations arising from the company’s participation in a corrupt scheme to pay bribes to Japanese government officials. BIT Mining entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in connection with a criminal information filed in the District of New Jersey charging BIT Mining with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA. A federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey returned an indictment against Pan on June 18. Pan is charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA, one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and two counts of violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA. “Paying bribes to foreign government officials is a serious crime. The top leadership of BIT Mining, then known as 500.com, directed consultants to pay bribes to Japanese government officials to win a bid to open a large resort in Japan. The illegal scheme started at the top, with the company’s CEO allegedly fully involved in directing the illicit payments and the subsequent efforts to conceal them. The company has admitted its crimes and agreed to pay a $10 million penalty, and its then-CEO has been charged for his role in the scheme. This agreement and indictment hold both the corporation as an entity and its top leadership accountable.” U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger “BIT Mining, under the alleged direction of then-CEO Zhengming Pan, agreed to pay nearly $2 million in bribes to Japanese government officials to win a contract to open a lucrative resort and casino in Japan,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said. “Pan has been indicted for his alleged role in directing company consultants to pay the bribes and to conceal the illicit payments through sham consulting contracts. Today’s resolution and the charges against Pan demonstrate the department’s continued commitment to holding both corporate and individual wrongdoers accountable for their crimes.” “Today’s indictment against the former CEO of BIT Mining for bribing Japanese officials highlights the FBI’s commitment to holding individuals accountable for illegal conduct,” Assistant Director Chad Yarbrough of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division said. “This type of criminal activity undermines the integrity of business practices. The FBI will relentlessly pursue those involved in illegal schemes creating unfair advantages and ensure they face the full consequences of the law.” According to court documents, between 2017 and 2019, BIT Mining, then known as 500.com, admitted that its -CEO Pan, employees, and agents, agreed to pay approximately $1.9 million in bribes and payments to intermediaries, knowing the money would be used to make bribe payments to Japanese government officials. The purpose of the bribes was to try to help 500.com win a bid to open an integrated resort (a large resort that includes hotels, casinos, retail, dining, convention facilities, and entertainment venues) in Japan. On behalf of 500.com, Pan allegedly engaged third-party consultants to assist 500.com in paying and concealing these bribes. 500.com, through these consultants, paid bribes in the form of cash, travel, entertainment, and gifts. Pan and others allegedly covered up the payment of these bribes by, among other things, entering into sham contracts with the consultants and falsely recording the payments as legitimate expenses, including as management advisory fees. Ultimately, despite carrying out this bribery scheme, 500.com did not win an integrated resort bid in Japan. Pursuant to the DPA, BIT Mining agreed, based on the application of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, that the appropriate criminal penalty is $54 million. However, due to BIT Mining’s financial condition and demonstrated inability to pay the penalty calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, BIT Mining and the Justice Department agreed, consistent with the department’s inability to pay guidance, that BIT Mining will pay a total criminal penalty of $10 million. The Justice Department has agreed to credit up to $4 million against the civil penalty BIT Mining has agreed to pay to the SEC to resolve a parallel investigation. BIT Mining has also agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey in any ongoing or future criminal investigations. In addition, BIT Mining has agreed to continue to enhance its compliance programs and provide reports to the Justice Department regarding remediation and the implementation of compliance measures for the three-year term of the DPA. The Justice Department reached this resolution with BIT Mining based on a number of factors, including, among others, the nature and seriousness of the offense. BIT Mining received credit for its cooperation with the department’s investigation, which included (i) voluntarily producing relevant documents, financial data, and other information, including from foreign countries, while navigating some foreign data privacy and related criminal laws, accompanied by translations of a limited number of documents; and (ii) providing the government with facts learned during its internal investigation. The cooperation was, however, reactive and limited in degree and impact. BIT Mining engaged in certain timely remedial measures, which included, among other things, (i) increasing governance and oversight of compliance risks and audit findings by the Board of Directors, (ii) promoting compliance and ethics through company-wide communications, (iii) incorporating compliance criteria in performance evaluations for senior management, (iv) conducting annual risk assessments, (v) creating an anti-corruption policy and engaging in company-wide training and communications to promote it, and (vi) transitioning its business model to an industry that presents a lower corruption risk and reducing its presence in high risk regions. In light of these considerations, BIT Mining’s criminal penalty calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines reflects a 10% reduction off the bottom of the applicable guidelines fine range. The FBI’s International Corruption Unit is investigating the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kozar for the District of New Jersey and Trial Attorneys Jil Simon and Ligia Markman of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting the cases. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs and authorities in Japan provided assistance in this matter. The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act matters.

The  Order directs the Department of Justice (Department) , through the Attorney General, for a period  of 180 days, to \"(i) cease initiation ofany new FCPA investigations or enforcement actions, unless  the Attorney General determines that an individual exception should be made; (ii) review in detail  all existing FCPA investigations or enforcement actions and take appropriate action with respect  to such matters to restore proper bounds on FCPA enforcement and preserve Presidential foreign  policy prerogatives; and (iii) issue updated guidelines or policies [governing investigations and  enforcement actions under the FCPA ], as appropriate , to adequately promote the President's Article  II authority to conduct foreign affairs and prioritize American interests, American economic  competitiveness with respect to other nations, and the efficient use of Federal law enforcement  resources. \" Id. § 2.  This memorandum establishes guidelines to ensure that FCPA investigations and  prosecutions are carried out in accordance with President Trump's directive by (1) limiting undue  burdens on American companies that operate abroad and (2) targeting enforcement actions against  conduct that directly undermines U.S. national interests. Effective today, prosecutors shall focus  on cases in which individuals have engaged in criminal misconduct and not attribute nonspecific  malfeasance to corporate structures; proceed as expeditiously as possible in their investigations;  and consider collateral consequences, such as the potential disruption to lawful business and the  impact on a company 's employees, throughout an investigation, not only at the resolution phase.  1 This guidance is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create, any right or benefit,  substantive or procedural , enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its  departments , agencies, or entities, its officers, employees , or agents, or any person.  Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General Page 2  Subject: Guidelines for investigations and Enforcement ofthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)  To evaluate whether to pursue FCPA investigations and enforcement actions, prosecutors  shall consider the non-exhausti ve factors set forth below.2 The initiation of all new FCPA  investigations or enforcement actions must be authorized by the Assistant Attorney General for the  Criminal Division (or the official acting in that capacity) or a more senior Department official. See  Order, § 2( c )(ii).  I. Executive Order Factors  A. Total Elimination ofCartels and Transnational Criminal Organizations3  On January 20, 2025, President Trump directed the federal government to revise existing  strategies to pursue the total elimination of Cartels and transnational criminal organizations  (TCOs). See Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations  AndSpecially Designated Global Terrorists (Jan. 20, 2025). This Executive Order determined that  Cartels and TCOs \"threaten the stability ofthe international order in the Western Hemisphere \" and  \"present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy  of the United States.\" Id. §§ l(b), (c). It also recognized international Cartels' \"infiltration into  foreign governments across the Western Hemisphere.\" Id.§ l(a)(iii).  Implementing this order, on February 5, 2025, Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi issued a  memorandum , Total Elimination of Cartels and Transnational Criminal Organizations, that,  among other things, directed the FCPA Unit in the Criminal Division's Fraud Section to prioritize  investigations related to foreign bribery that facilitates the criminal operations ofCartels and TCOs  and shift focus away from cases that do not involve such a connection. Territories dominated by  Cartels, criminal gangs, and other transnational criminal organizations foster instability and  violence and threaten the erosion ofthe rule oflaw and economic growth. Pursuing the eradication  of Cartels and TCOs will require a sustained effort to prosecute their corrupt associates and  dismantle the financing mechanisms and shell companies used by these criminal networks . The  benefits of eliminating Cartels and TCOs will redound to American enterprise and the Nation as a  whole.  Accordingly, one primary consideration in deciding whether to pursue an FCPA  investigation or enforcement action is whether the alleged misconduct (1) is associated with the  criminal operations of a Cartel or TCO; (2) utilizes money launderers or shell companies that  engage in money laundering for Cartels or TCOs; or (3) is linked to employees of state-owned  entities or other foreign officials who have received bribes from Cartels or TCOs.  B. Safeguarding Fair Opportunities for U.S. Companies  Economic growth and expansion of U.S. business opportunities abroad-including U.S.  companies' competitiveness -is critical to safeguarding U.S. national security and economic  2 Prosecutors should account for the fact that they may not have as much insight into all of the facts of a  case at the beginning of a matter as when making charging decisions. Prosecutors must therefore account  for new information learned during the course ofan investigation in applying these factors.  3 This memorandum does not apply to the Department 's other efforts to secure the total elimination of  Cartels and TCOs-many of which have now been designated as foreign terrorist organizations-including  pursuit of material support of terrorism and violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers  Act (IEEPA) and the Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA).  2  Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General Page 3  Subject: Guidelines for Investigations and Enforcement ofthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)  prosperity. In addition to distorting markets and undermining the rule oflaw, companies that bribe  foreign officials to obtain business can put their law-abiding competitors , including U.S.  companies, at a serious economic disadvantage .4 By bribing foreign officials to obtain lucrative  contracts and illicit profits-at times hundreds of millions of dollars-corrupt competitors skew  markets and disadvantage law-abiding U.S. companies and others for many years.  The Department's FCPA enforcement will seek to vindicate these interests, not by focusing  on particular individuals or companies on the basis of their nationality, but by identifying and  prioritizing the investigation and prosecution of conduct that most undermines these principles.  Therefore , another important factor prosecutors shall consider is whether the alleged misconduct  deprived specific and identifiable U.S. entities of fair access to compete and/or resulted in  economic injury to specific and identifiable American companies or individuals. Similarly, in  conducting investigations and prosecutions under the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act, 18 U.S.C.  § 1352, which criminalizes the \"demand side\" of foreign bribery, prosecutors should consider  whether specific and identifiable U.S. entities or individuals have been harmed by foreign officials'  demands for bribes.  C. Advancing U.S. National Security  \"American national security depends in substantial part on the United States and its  companies gaining strategic business advantages whether in critical minerals, deep-water ports, or  other key infrastructure or assets.\" Order, § 1. As President Trump's National Security Strategy  from 2017 correctly observed, \"[t]errorists and criminals thrive where governments are weak,  corruption is rampant, and faith in government institutions is low. Strategic competitors often  exploit rather than discourage corruption and state weakness to extract resources and exploit their  populations. \"5 When this corruption occurs in sectors like defense, intelligence , or critical  infrastructure , American national security interests may be harmed. FCPA enforcement will  therefore focus on the most urgent threats to U.S. national security resulting from the bribery of  corrupt foreign officials involving key infrastructure or assets.  D. Prioritizing Investigations of Serious Misconduct  The Order instructed that FCPA enforcement should not penalize \"American citizens and  business\" for \"routine business practices in other nations.\" Order, § 1. When conducting  investigations, prosecutors must be mindful that the FCPA contains an exception for facilitating  and expediting payments, see, e.g. 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-l(b) , and it provides affirmative defenses for  reasonable and bona fide expenditures and payments that are lawful under the written laws of the  foreign country, see, e.g. id. § 78dd-1 ( c ).  But beyond that, to best advance the priorities articulated above, FCPA investigations and  enforcement actions shall not focus on alleged misconduct involving routine business practices or  4 The most blatant bribery schemes have historically been committed by foreign companies , as reflected by  the fact that the most significant FCPA enforcement actions-measured both by the scope of misconduct  and the size of the monetary penalties imposed-have been overwhelmingly brought against foreign  companies .  5 National Security Strategy of the United States of America (Dec. 2017), at 45, available at  https://trumpwh itehouse.archives.gov /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final -12-18-2017-0905.pdf.  3  Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General Page 4  Subject: Guidelines for Investigations and Enforcement ofthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)  the type ofcorporate conduct that involves de minimis or low-dollar, generally accepted business  courtesies. Rather, the focus ofFCPA enforcement will be on alleged misconduct that bears strong  indicia of corrupt intent tied to particular individuals , such as substantial bribe payments , proven  and sophisticated efforts to conceal bribe payments , fraudulent conduct in furtherance of the  bribery scheme, and efforts to obstruct justice. To prioritize cases that warrant investigation by  U.S. authorities, FCPA prosecutors should also consider the likelihood (or lack thereof) that an  appropriate foreign law enforcement authority is willing and able to investigate and prosecute the  same alleged misconduct.  II. Additional Considerations  The guidelines set forth herein are not exhaustive. As with every criminal case, myriad  factors must be considered when determining whether to investigate or prosecute. In addition to  the factors outlined above, prosecutors must also follow other applicable policies and relevant  factors. For instance, as in all matters, prosecutors are bound by the Principles of Federal  Prosecution, see Justice Manual§§ 9-27.001 , et seq., which require consideration ofthe nature and  seriousness of the offenses and the deterrent effect of prosecution , among other factors. Such  criteria may be considered when the Department determines whether to authorize particular new  FCPA investigations and enforcement actions, consistent with the Order. Order, § 2(a)(i).  Similarly, the Department 's interests in pursuing cases that have already entered the judicial  process-such as filed indictments and corporate resolutions-versus those that have not, may  differ. The Department retains prosecutorial discretion to continue or terminate such actions based  on the totality of the circumstances.  III. Ongoing Review  The Order requires the Department, within 180 days, to review in detail all existing FCPA  investigations or enforcement actions and take appropriate action. Order, § 2(a)(ii). Cases that  have been reviewed have been evaluated based on the principles set forth in this memorandum.  All current and future investigations and enforcement actions shall be governed by these guidelines  and other applicable policies.  4 "}

The Fraud Section continues to be a national leader in white  collar criminal enforcement —not just in precedent -setting  prosecutions, convictions, and resolutions, but also in pursuing  innovative practices to continuously improve our enforcement of  white -collar criminal laws and developing Division -and Department wide policies to enhance law enforcement practices. I am  consistently impressed with the hard work and commitment of  Fraud Section prosecutors and support staff. The document that  follows presents a snapshot of the accomplishments of these  dedicated professionals, in partnership with our law enforcement  and regulatory colleagues in the United States and overseas.  2022 was a banner year for the Fraud Section in many respects. Our  prosecutors continued pursuing complex, righteous cases and  recorded the highest number of trials and trial convictions by the  Section in any year. Specifically, 78 Fraud Section attorneys (over  50% of the attorneys in the litigating units) tried 51 cases in 22  federal districts. Section attorneys tried 72 individuals and convicted  56 individuals at trial. Despite this heavy trial docket, Fraud Section  attorneys also charged 280 individuals and convicted 342  individuals. The Fraud Section also entered into 7 corporate  resolutions and announced two corporate enforcement policy (CEP)  declinations in 2022. Additionally, the Fraud Section led crucial  initiatives, such as the formation of the New England Prescription  Opioid Strike Force and the Crypto Fraud National Enforcement  Action.

See Pub. Law 118-78.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) has long  prosecuted corrupt foreign offici als under other federal laws, incl uding, but not limited to, money  laundering statutes.  FEPA complements the FCPA by creating a new statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1352,  which makes it a crime for any fore ign official (as defined in FEPA2), or a person selected to be a  foreign official, to corruptly demand, seek, receive,  accept, or agree to receive or accept, directly  or indirectly, payments from certain classes of persons and entities by maki ng use of the mails or  any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in return for taking certain actions and in connection with obtaining or retaining business.  FEPA generally mirrors the FCPA by defining  those classes of persons and entities as (i) “issuers” and “domestic concerns,” as defined in 15 U.S.C. §§ 78c(a) and 78dd-2, respectively, and th eir officers, directors,  employees, agents, or  stockholders thereof acting on their behalf; and (ii) “persons,” as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-3, if  the foreign official or a person ac ting on behalf of the foreign official is in the territory of the  United States.  A violation of FEPA is punishable by up to  15 years’ imprisonmen t and a maximum fine  of $250,000 or three times the mone tary equivalent of the thing of value demanded by the foreign  official.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1352(b)(2).  Unlike portions of the FCPA, FEPA does not provide any  civil remedies or grant enforcement authority to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   FEPA also requires DOJ, in consultation w ith the State Departme nt, to provide annual  reports to Congress beginning in July 2025 about , among other things, DOJ ’s enforcement of  FEPA.  DOJ policy provides that the Cr iminal Division’s Fraud Sect ion has exclusive jurisdiction  over and primary responsibility for all FEPA matters, just as it does for all FCPA matters.  See  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Ju stice Manual § 9-47.110, available at  https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-947000-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-1977 .  The FCPA Unit within th e Fraud Section handles all  FEPA (and FCPA) matters for DOJ and regularly works with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices around the  country on such cases.    1 As with the Resource Guide to th e U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,  this addendum is not intended to,  does not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights,  substantive or procedural, that are enforceable  at law by any party, in any criminal, civil, or administra tive matter.  It is not intended to substitute for the  advice of legal counsel on specific issues related to FEPA.  It does not in any way limit the enforcement  intentions or litigating positions of the U.S. Departm ent of Justice or any other U.S. government agency.    2 See 18 U.S.C. § 1352(a)(1). "}

Credit for Voluntary Self-Disclosure...Remediation in <strong>FCPA</strong> Matters Due to the unique issues presented in <strong>FCPA</strong> matters, including"], "texto": "9-47.120 - FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy   1.         Credit  for Voluntary Self-Disclosure, Full Cooperation, and Timely and Appropriate  Remediation in FCPA Matters   Due to the unique issues presented in FCPA matters, including their inherently international  character and other factors, the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy is aimed at providing additional benefits to companies based on their corporate behavior once they learn of misconduct. When a company has voluntarily self-disclosed misconduct in an FCPA matter, fully cooperated, and timely and appropriately rem ediated, all in accordance with the standards  set forth below, there will be a presumption that the company will receive a declination absent aggravating circumstances involving the seriousness of the offense or the nature of the offender. Aggravating circumstances that may warrant a criminal resolution include, but are not limited to, involvement by executive management of the company in the misconduct; a significant profit to the company from the misconduct; pervasiveness of the misconduct within the company; and criminal recidivism.   If a criminal resolution is warranted for a company that has voluntarily self-disclosed, fully  cooperated, and timely and appropriately remediated, the Fraud Section:  • will accord, or recommend to a sentencing court, a 50% reduction off of the low end of  the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) fine range, except in the case of a criminal  recidivist; and   • generally will not require appointment of a monitor if a company h as, at the time of  resolution, implemented an effective compliance program.      To qualify for the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy, the company is required to pay all  disgorgement, forfeiture, and/or restitution resulting from the misconduct at issue.     2.         Limited Credit for Full Cooperation and Timely and Appropriate Remediation in FCPA  Matters Without Voluntary Self -Disclosure   If a company did not voluntarily disclose its misconduct to the Department of Justice (the  Department) in accordance w ith the standards set forth above, but later fully cooperated and  timely and appropriately remediated in accordance with the standards set forth above, the company will receive, or the Department will recommend to a sentencing court, up to a 25% reduction off of the low end of the U.S.S.G. fine range.          3.         Definitions   a. Voluntary Self- Disclosure in FCPA Matters   In evaluating self -disclosure, the Department will make a careful assessment of the  circumstances of the disclosure. The Department will require the following items for a company  to receive credit for voluntary self -disclosure of wrongdoing:  • The voluntary disclosure qualifies under U.S.S.G. § 8C2.5(g)(1) as occurring “prior to an  imminent threat of disclosure or government investigation”;  • The company discloses the conduct to the Department “within a reasonably prompt time  after becoming aware of the offense,” with the burden being on the company to demonstrate timeliness; and   • The company discloses all relevant facts known to it, including all relevant facts about all individuals substantially involved in or responsible for the violation of law.     b. Full Cooperation in FCPA Matters  In addition to the provisions contained in the Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations to satisfy the threshold for any cooperation credit, see JM 9-28.000, the following items will be required for a company to receive maximum credit for full cooperation for  purposes of JM 9-47.120(1) (beyond the credit available under the U.S.S.G.):  • Discl osure on a timely basis of all facts relevant to the wrongdoing at issue, including: all  relevant facts gathered during a company’s independent investigation; attribution of facts  to specific sources where such attribution does not violate the attorney- client privilege,  rather than a general narrative of the facts; timely updates on a company’s internal investigation, including but not limited to rolling disclosures of information; all facts  related to involvement in the criminal activity by the company’s o fficers, employees, or  agents; and all facts known or that become known to the company regarding potential  criminal conduct by all third -party companies (including their officers, employees, or  agents);   • Proactive cooperation, rather than reactive; that is, the company must timely disclose all facts that are relevant to the investigation, even when not specifically asked to do so, and, where the company is or should be aware of opportunities for the Department to obtain relevant evidence not in the company’s  possession and not otherwise known to the  Department, it must identify those opportunities to the Department;   • Timely preservation, collection, and disclosure of relevant documents and information relating to their provenance, including (a) disclosure of overseas documents, the locations in which such documents were found, and who found the documents, (b) facilitation of third -party production of documents, and (c) where requested and appropriate, provision  of translations of relevant documents in foreign languages;  o Note: Where a company claims that disclosure of overseas documents is prohibited due to data privacy, blocking statutes, or other reasons related to  foreign law, the company bears the burden of establishing the prohibition.  Moreover, a company sh ould work diligently to identify all available legal bases  to provide such documents;  • Where requested and appropriate, de-confliction of witness interviews and other  investigative steps that a company intends to take as part of its internal investigation with  steps that the Department intends to take as part of its investigation[1]; and   • Where requested, making available for interviews by the Department those company officers and employees who possess relevant information; this includes, where appropriate and possible, officers, employees, and agents located overseas as well as former offi cers and employees (subject to the individuals’ Fifth Amendment rights), and,  where possible, the facilitation of third-party production of witnesses.     c. Timely and Appropriate Remediation in FCPA Matters   The following items will be required for a compan y to receive full credit for timely and  appropriate remediation for purposes of JM 9-47.120(1) (beyond the credit available under the  U.S.S.G.):  • Demonstration of thorough analysis of causes of underlying conduct (i.e., a root cause  analysis) and, where ap propriate, remediation to address the root causes;  • Implementation of an effective compliance and ethics program, the criteria for which will be periodically updated and which may vary based on the size and resources of the organization, but may include:  o The company’s culture of compliance, including awareness among employees  that any criminal conduct, including the conduct underlying the investigation, will  not be tolerated;  o The resources the company has dedicated to compliance;   o The quality and experience o f the personnel involved in compliance, such that  they can understand and identify the transactions and activities that pose a  potential risk;  o The authority and independence of the compliance function and the availability of compliance expertise to the board;   o The effectiveness of the company’s risk assessment and the manner in which the company’s compliance program has been tailored based on that risk assessment;  o The compensation and promotion of the personnel involved in compliance, in  view of their role, responsibilities, performance, and other appropriate factors;  o The auditing of the compliance program to assure its effectiveness; and   o The reporting structure of any compliance personnel employed or contracted by  the company.   • Appropriate discipline of employees, including those identified by the company as responsible for the misconduct, either through direct participation or failure in oversight, as well as those with supervisory authority over the area in which the criminal conduct occurred;   • Appropriate retention of business records, and prohibiting the improper destruction or  deletion of business records, including implementing appropriate guidance and controls on the use of personal communications and ephemeral messaging platforms that undermine the company’s ability to appropriately retain business records or  communications or otherwise comply with the company’s document retention policies or  legal obligations; and   • Any additional steps that demonstrate recognition of the seriousness of the company’s misco nduct, acceptance of responsibility for it, and the implementation of measures to  reduce the risk of repetition of such misconduct, including measures to identify future  risks.   4. Comment  Cooperation Credit :  Cooperation comes in many forms. Once the threshold requirements set out  at JM 9 -28.700 have been met, the Department will assess the scope, quantity, quality, and  timing of cooperation based on the circumstances of each case when assessing how to evaluate a company’s cooperation under the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy.   “De- confliction” is one factor that the Department may consider in appropriate cases in  evaluating whether and how much credit that a company will receive for cooperation. When the  Department does make a request to a company to defer  investigative steps, such as the interview  of company employees or third parties, such a request will be made for a limited period of time and be narrowly tailored to a legitimate investigative purpose (e.g., to prevent the impeding of a specified aspect of the Department’s investigation). Once the justification dissipates, the  Department will notify the company that the Department is lifting its request.   Where a company asserts that its financial condition impairs its ability to cooperate more fully,  the company will bear the burden to provide factual support for such an assertion. The  Department will closely evaluate the validity of any such claim and will take the impediment  into consideration in assessing whether the company has fully cooperated.   As set forth in JM 9-28.720, eligibility for cooperation or voluntary self-disclosure credit is not  in any way predicated upon waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work product protection, and none of the requirements above require such waiver. Nothing herein alters that policy, which remains in full force and effect. Furthermore, not all companies will satisfy all the components of  full cooperation for purposes of JM 9-47.120(2) and (3)(b), either because they decide to  cooperate only later in an inv estigation or they timely decide to cooperate but fail to meet all of  the criteria listed above. In general, such companies will be eligible for some cooperation credit if they meet the criteria of JM 9 -28.700, but the credit generally will be markedly less than for  full cooperation, depending on the extent to which the cooperation was lacking.   Remediation:  In order for a company to receive full credit for remediation and avail itself of the  benefits of the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy, the company must have effectively  remediated at the time of the resolution.        The requirement that a c ompany pay all disgorgement, forfeiture, and/or restitution resulting  from the misconduct at issue may be satisfied by a parallel resolution with a relevant regulator  (e.g., the United States Securities and Exchange Commission).   M&A Due Diligence and Rem ediation: The Department recognizes the potential benefits of  corporate mergers and acquisitions, particularly when the acquiring entity has a robust  compliance program in place and implements that program as quickly as practicable at the merged or acquire d entity. Accordingly, where a company undertakes a merger or acquisition,  uncovers misconduct through thorough and timely due diligence or, in appropriate instances, through post-acquisition audits or compliance integration efforts, and voluntarily self-discloses  the misconduct and otherwise takes action consistent with this Policy (including, among other  requirements, the timely implementation of an effective compliance program at the merged or acquired entity), there will be a presumption of a declinatio n in accordance with and subject to  the other requirements of this Policy.[2]   Public Release:  A declination pursuant to the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy is a case that  would have been prosecuted or criminally resolved except for the company’s voluntary disclosure, full cooperation, remediation, and payment of disgorgement, forfeiture, and/or restitution. If a case would have been declined in the absence of such circumstances, it is not a declination pursuant to this Policy. Declinations awarded under the FCPA Corporate  Enforcement Policy will be made public.  [1]: Although the Department may, where appropriate, request that a company refrain from  taking a specific action for a limited period of time for de -confliction purposes, the Department  will not take any steps to affirmatively direct a company’s internal investigation efforts.   [2]: In appropriate cases, an acquiring company that discloses misconduct may be eligible for a  declination, even if aggravating circumstances existed as to the acquired entity.

Background The facts at issue in this"], "texto": "1   No. 22-1  Date:  January 21, 2022  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Review  Opinion Procedure Release        The Department reviewed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) Opinion request of  a U.S.-based company (“Requestor”).  The Request was submitted on October 19 and 20, 2021  (the “Request”).  In light of the unusual and exigent circumstances presented by this Request,  including the risk of imminent harm to the health and well-being of the individuals noted in the  Request, the Department provided Requestor with a short preliminary opinion on October 21,  2021.1  On November 19 and December 21, 2021, Requestor provided additional information in  response to questions from the Department.    Requestor is a “domestic concern” under 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-2(h)(1) and therefore is eligible  to request an Opinion of the U.S. Attorney General, pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 80.4, regarding  whether certain specified, prospective — not hypothetical — conduct conforms with the  Department’s present enforcement policy regarding the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.  Background  The facts at issue in this Request arose from the detention by Country A naval forces of  the captain and crew of a maritime vessel owned by Requestor (the “Requestor vessel”).  The  Requestor vessel was seeking to anchor in international waters while awaiting entry into the port  of Country B in order to undergo required maintenance and to renew technical maritime  certificates.  When the Requestor vessel arrived in Country B, one of Requestor’s shipping agents  advised the captain that the Country B ports were fully occupied and the Requestor vessel would  need to anchor outside of Country B for two weeks.  The shipping agent gave incorrect anchoring  coordinates to the captain, which led the captain to anchor in Country A’s waters inadvertently.     The Country A Navy intercepted the Requestor vessel and directed it into a Country A  harbor, where the Country A Navy confiscated the Requestor vessel’s logbook and officers’ and  crew’s documents and told the captain that he would be detained for questioning ashore, while the  crew members and officers were ordered to remain on board the ship.  Once onshore, the captain    1 The preliminary opinion stated: The Department of Justice (the “Department”) has received the Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act (“FCPA”) Opinion request of [Requestor], submitted on October 19 and 20, 2021 (the “Request”).  Due  to the highly unusual and exigent circumstances identified in the Request, including the risk of imminent harm to the  health and well-being of the individuals noted therein, the Department provides this preliminary response in complete  reliance upon the accuracy of representations made by [Requestor] and its agents.  Based upon all of the facts and  circumstances, as represented by [Requestor] in the Request, the Department does not presently intend to take an  enforcement action under the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions in response to the contemplated payment referenced in  the Request.  A full response to the Request will be forthcoming in accordance with the FCPA Opinion Procedure, 28  C.F.R. part 80, following further evaluation of additional information and responses to requests for information that  were sent to you on October 20, 2021, as well as possible additional questions and requests, all of which you have  committed to providing.   2   was detained in jail without being questioned or provided any documentation authorizing his arrest  or detention.  An incident report by the Country A Navy notes that the Requestor vessel was in  Country A waters in violation of various laws and treaties.   Requestor has provided information  and documentation showing that the captain was at that time suffering from serious medical  conditions that would be significantly exacerbated by the circumstances and conditions of his  detention and created a significant risk to his life and well-being.     Shortly following the detention of the captain onshore and of the crew onboard the  Requestor vessel, a third party purporting to act on behalf of the Country A Navy (the “Third-Party  Intermediary”) approached Requestor and demanded a financial payment to release the captain  and to permit the crew and the vessel to leave Country A waters.  To engage with the Third-Party Intermediary, Requestor retained the services of an agent  (“Requestor Agent”) with which Requestor was familiar from previous work and on which  Requestor had recently conducted due diligence.  Requestor and Requestor Agent repeatedly asked  the Third-Party Intermediary to provide a formal basis for the payment — such as an invoice or  other documentation setting forth charges or an enumerated fine amount — to ensure that the  payment would be made pursuant to a fine or other penalty resulting from a legal or regulatory  violation, if any.  This request was repeatedly rejected by the Third-Party Intermediary.  Requestor  also sought the assistance from other agencies within the U.S. government to end the captain’s  detention and permit the Requestor vessel and its crew to leave Country A expeditiously.   Requestor also requested that those agencies notify relevant Country A authorities of the detention  of the captain and crew, and the confiscation of the Requestor vessel.   None of those avenues bore fruit.  Instead, the Third-Party Intermediary told Requestor  Agent and Requestor that to resolve the matter expeditiously and obtain the release of the captain,  the vessel, and the crew, Requestor needed to make a payment in cash of $175,000 to the ThirdParty Intermediary imminently; otherwise the captain and the crew members would be detained  for a longer period of time and the vessel would be seized.   Although the Third-Party Intermediary represented the payment to be an official payment  to the government of Country A, the nature of the demand and the manner of payment raised  concerns for Requestor that the payment was intended for one or more Country A government  officials.  The Request seeks an Opinion as to whether the Department, based on the facts and  representations provided by Requestor regarding the demanded cash payment, would presently  intend to bring an enforcement action under the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions against Requestor  if the Company were to make such payment to the Third-Party Intermediary.    Analysis  Based on the specific facts presented by Requestor, the proposed payment would not  trigger an enforcement action under the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA because Requestor  would not be making the payment “corruptly” or to “obtain or retain business.”  The FCPA  prohibits, inter alia, any domestic concern from corruptly giving or offering anything of value to  any “foreign official” to assist “in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business  to, any person.”  15 U.S.C. § 78dd-2(a).  “Corruptly” means an intent or desire to wrongfully  3   influence the recipient.  The “business purpose” test of the FCPA is met where the purpose of the  payment or offer is to assist in obtaining and retaining business.2      The facts presented by Requestor demonstrate that the proposed payment would not be  made with corrupt intent.  Based on the information from Requestor, the primary reason for the  payment was to avoid imminent and potentially serious harm to the captain and the crew of the  Requestor vessel.3  Under the FCPA, “[a] person acts corruptly if he acts voluntarily  and  intentionally, with an improper motive of accomplishing either an unlawful result or a lawful result  by some unlawful method or means.  The term ‘corruptly’ is intended to connote that the offer,  payment, and promise was intended to influence an official to misuse his official position.”  United  States v. Kozeny , 667 F.3d 122, 135 (2d Cir. 2011).  Conversely, “an individual who is forced to  make payment on threat of injury or death would not be liable under the FCPA.  Federal criminal  law provides that actions taken under duress do not ordinarily constitute crimes.”  United States v.  Kozeny, 582 F. Supp. 2d 535, 540 n.31 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); see also Crim. Div. of the U.S. Dept. of  Justice and the Enf’t Div. of the U.S. Sec. and Exch. Comm’n, A Resource Guide to the U.S.  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 27 (2d ed. 2020), available at https://www.justice.gov/criminalfraud/ file/1292051/download (hereinafter, “Resource Guide”) (“Situations involving extortion or  duress will not give rise to FCPA liability because a payment made in response to true extortionate  demands under imminent threat of physical harm cannot be said to have been made with corrupt  intent or for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.”) .        Moreover, based upon the information provided, the payment is not motivated by an intent  to obtain or retain business.  Requestor has no ongoing or anticipated business with Country A,  and the entire episode appears to be the result of an error, emanating from the incorrect advice  Requestor received about where to anchor its ship while waiting for the port of Country B to carry  out mandatory repairs.  In so doing, it is possible that Requestor inadvertently violated Country A,  and perhaps other, regulations and laws governing shipping routes and anchoring locations.  It is  this error that triggered the payment demand by the Third-Party Intermediary.  Rather than conceal  the payment demand, Requestor engaged with various U.S. government personnel and requested  proper documentation from the Country A government setting forth the alleged violation and  appropriate fine.4  Only when none of these efforts bore fruit, and Requestor was told that the only  way to secure the safe and prompt release of the captain and crew was through a payment of  $175,000 in cash, did Requestor consider making such payment and submit the FCPA Opinion   2 See H.R. Rep. No. 100-576, at 1951-52 (In amending the FCPA in 1988, Congress noted on the business purpose of  the FCPA that “the reference to corrupt payments for ‘retaining business’ in present law is not limited to the renewal  of contracts or other business, but also includes a prohibition against corrupt payments related to the execution or  performance of contracts or the carrying out of existing business, such as a payment to a foreign official for the purpose  of obtaining more favorable tax treatment.”).    3 Among other things, Requestor described the conditions of the captain’s detention, including the lack of medical  treatment and medical equipment necessary to manage the captain’s serious medical condition, thus creating a serious  and imminent threat to his health, safety, and well-being.      4 In contacting appropriate U.S. government authorities in Country A in connection with the payment demand,  Requestor acted in accordance with the recommendation in the FCPA Guide.  See p. 28 (“If such a situation [of  imminent threats to health or safety of its employees] arises, and to ensure the safety of its employees, companies  should immediately contact the appropriate U.S. embassy for assistance.”).  4   Request.  Put simply, under the specific facts presented by Requestor, there does not appear to be  a sufficient business purpose associated with the payment — and relatedly, there is a lack of a  corrupt intent under the FCPA.      The situation at hand is thus readily distinguishable from other situations in which a  company is threatened with severe economic or financial consequences in the absence of a  payment.  As noted in the Resource Guide, when enacting the FCPA, Congress explained that  “[t]he defense that the payment was demanded on the part of a government official as a price for  gaining entry into a market or to obtain a contract would not suffice since at some point the U.S.  company would make a conscious decision whether or not to pay a bribe.”  Resource Guide at 2728, quoting S. Rep. No. 95-114, at 10-11.  The fact that the payment was “first proposed by the  recipient…does not alter the corrupt purpose on the part of the person paying the bribe.”  Id.   In  contrast, payments under circumstances that companies may perceive as economically coercive,  especially in countries in which they are in historical, pending, ongoing, anticipated, or sought  after business relationships with government actors may well give rise to liability under the FCPA.       Finally, this Opinion is limited to an analysis of whether the payment at issue would trigger  an enforcement action under the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.  Beyond this narrow analysis,  the Department offers no view on the permissibility or legality of the payment under any other  laws, including the laws of Country A.      This FCPA Opinion Release has no binding application to any party other than Requestor  and can be relied on by Requestor only to the extent that the disclosure of facts and circumstances  in its Request and supplemental information is accurate and complete.

Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Special Agent in Charge Kelly Jackson of the IRS-Criminal Investigation’s (IRS-CI) Washington, D.C. office, Special Agent in Charge Raymond Villanueva of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Washington, D.C., office and Special Agent in Charge George Piro of the FBI’s Miami Field Office made the announcement. Frank Roberto Chatburn Ripalda (Chatburn), 42, a dual U.S. and Ecuadorian citizen, pleaded guilty in federal district court in Miami before the Honorable Marcia G. Cooke to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a 20-year statutory maximum sentence.  Chatburn is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Cooke on Dec. 18. According to his admissions at the plea hearing, Chatburn conspired with an oil services contractor to pay nearly $3 million in bribes to Ecuadorian government officials in an effort to obtain and retain contracts with PetroEcuador.  As a financial advisor to the contractor, Chatburn agreed to make bribe payments for the benefit of several then-PetroEcuador officials through the use of shell companies and bank accounts in the United States, Panama, the Cayman Islands, Curacao and Switzerland.  To conceal the bribe payments and to promote the scheme, Chatburn established Panamanian shell companies with Swiss bank accounts on behalf of two then-PetroEcuador officials. Chatburn further admitted that he conspired with another Ecuadorian government official to conceal bribe payments intended for the official from Odebrecht S.A., the Brazilian construction conglomerate.  Chatburn facilitated hiding these bribe payments by conducting the transactions through several shell companies and bank accounts in multiple jurisdictions, including in the United States. Odebrecht S.A. pleaded guilty on Dec. 21, 2016, in the Eastern District of New York to conspiring to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA in connection with a broader scheme to pay nearly $800 million in bribes to public officials in twelve countries, including Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Mozambique, Panama, Peru and Venezuela. To date, 10 individuals, including former Ecuadorian government officials, oil services contractors and financial advisors, have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in U.S. courts for their involvement in the PetroEcuador bribery and money laundering schemes. This case was investigated by HSI and IRS-CI, jointly under the auspices of the Global Illicit Financial Team, and by the FBI’s International Corruption Squad in Miami.  Southern District of Florida Assistant U.S. Attorneys Karen Rochlin,  Nalina Sombuntham and Alison W. Lehr have provided substantial assistance with the prosecution of this case, along with Deputy Chief Brian Young, Assistant Chiefs David Fuhr and Lorinda Laryea, Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and Trial Attorneys Randall Warden and Mary Ann McCarthy of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS). The U.S. Marshals Service and the Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs have provided significant assistance by obtaining evidence in this case, as have public authorities in, among other countries, Ecuador, Panama and the Cayman Islands. MLARS’s Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers and employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system. The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters.  Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.
